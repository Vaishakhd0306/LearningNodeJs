// ALL ABOUT TERMINAL:

1. echo = used as console;
2. pwd = PrintWorkingDirectory -> prints current directory path
3. whoami = shows current user

Navigating the file:
1.cd = change directory
2.cd .. = onstep back from current directory
3. cd ~ = moves to home directory
4.ls = list ( content list )
5.ls -a = list all even hidden files


Create/ Copy/ Move/ delete/ Directories

1. touch = create file
  if we need to create multiple files then : touch app.js index.js styles.css


2. rm= remove file
  if we need to create multiple files then : rm app.js index.js styles.css

3. mkdir = creates a directory/folder

4. rmdir = removes a directory/folder
   rmdir = removes empty folder;
   rm -r = removes folder even if it has multiple files


5. cp = copy the file from one to another folder:
   cp app.js src : this will copy app.js to src folder

6.mv = move the file from one place to another;
    mv script.js src : This will move script.js to src folder

7. cd ./ = current directory

"TERMINAL IS LIKE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE PLATFORM WHERE WE CAN ADD COMMANDS AND DO WHAT IS REQUIRED 
SUCH AS CREATING 1000'S OF FILE BY WRITING COMMAND IN TERMINAL; WHICH ALSO ACCEPTS IF/LOOPS ETC;
EXAMPLE: for i in {1..1000}; do rm "app$i.js"

logics such as :
num1=10
num2=20
num3=$((num1+num2))
echo $num3

-----VIEWING AND EDITING FILES WITH COMMANDS:

To view : use cat

cat app.js ->to read app.js file;

To edit : we have 2 commands:
   1. Nano
   2. Vim

   a.nano script.js -> To edit files -> easy 

   b.vim app.js-> powerful editor
    To exit we need to click on  "esc"  button. It will show 2 modes:
    1."Insert mode" for editing : click on i;
     :w -> save-> write 
     :q -> quit
     :q! -> Force exit
     :wq -> save and exit 

TERMINAL PROMPT:
PS means Prompt String-> PS1 and PS2; 
WE CAN EDIT PS1 prompt and can modify how ever we need using chatgpt;
